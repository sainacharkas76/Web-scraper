We performed single-cell transcriptome analysis of newly established HBV-positive and HBV-negative hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and found that dedicator of cytokinesis 11 (DOCK11) was crucially involved in HBV persistence. However, the roles of DOCK11 in the HBV lifecycle have not been clarified. METHODS: The cccDNA levels were measured by Southern blotting and real-time detection polymerase chain reaction in various hepatocytes including PXB cells by using an HBV-infected model. The retrograde trafficking route of HBV capsid was investigated by super-resolution microscopy, proximity ligation assay, and time-lapse analysis. The downstream molecules of DOCK11 and underlying mechanism were examined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, immunoblotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The cccDNA levels were strongly increased by DOCK11 overexpression and repressed by DOCK11 suppression. Interestingly, DOCK11 functionally associated with retrograde trafficking proteins in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), Arf-GAP with GTPase domain, ankyrin repeat, and pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein 2, and ADP-ribosylation factor 1, together with HBV capsid, to open an alternative retrograde trafficking route for HBV from early endosomes (EEs) to the TGN and then to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby avoiding lysosomal degradation. Clinically, DOCK11 levels in liver biopsies from patients with chronic hepatitis B were significantly reduced by entecavir treatment, and this reduction correlated with HBV surface antigen levels. CONCLUSIONS: HBV uses a retrograde trafficking route via EEs-TGN-ER for infection that is facilitated by DOCK11 and serves to maintain cccDNA. Therefore, DOCK11 is a potential therapeutic target to prevent persistent HBV infection.",Journal Article,

Because gut microbiota and BAs could influence each other, the mechanism of changes in both by HFHSD is complicated and remains unclear. We first aimed to clarify the roles of BAs in the HFHSD-induced change of gut microbiota. Then, we studied the effects of the changed gut microbiota on BA composition and liver function. Male wild-type (WT) and human-like Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice derived from C57BL/6J were fed with normal chow or HFHSD for 4 weeks. Gut microbiomes were analyzed by fecal 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, and BA composition was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The DKO mice exhibited significantly reduced fecal BA concentration, lacked muricholic acids, and increased proportions of chenodeoxycholic and lithocholic acids. Despite the marked difference in the fecal BA composition, the profiles of gut microbiota in the two mouse models were quite similar. An HFHSD resulted in a significant increase in the BA pool and fecal BA excretion in WT mice but not in DKO mice. However, microbial composition in the two mouse models was drastically but similarly changed by the HFHSD. In addition, the HFHSD-induced change of gut microbiota inhibited BA deconjugation and 7alpha-dehydroxylation in both types of mice, which improved chronic liver injury observed in DKO mice. Conclusion: The HFHSD itself causes the change of gut microbiota due to HFHSD, and the altered composition or concentration of BAs by HFHSD is not the primary factor. On the contrary, the gut microbiota formed by HFHSD affects BA composition and ameliorates liver injury in the mouse model with human-like hydrophobic BA composition.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",

However, early discontinuation of lenvatinib because of adverse effects is a frequent occurrence. Hence, lenvatinib is a difficult drug for use in the clinical setting. One of the causes is that the dose of lenvatinib is mainly determined by body weight alone, despite high interindividual variability. To overcome this problem, a dosing regimen of lenvatinib based on a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model for HCC patients is proposed. The aim of this study was to develop a high-throughput quantification method for lenvatinib using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) that can be applied to a PPK analysis of HCC patients in the future. METHODS: After a simple solid-phase extraction step using a 96-well plate, lenvatinib was analyzed by UHPLC-MS/MS in a positive electrospray ionization mode. RESULTS: The novel method fulfilled the requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration guidance on bioanalytical method validation. The calibration curve was linear over the 0.2-1000 ng/mL concentration range. The average recovery rate was 98.63 +/- 4.55% (mean +/- SD). The precision was below 6.05%, and the accuracy was within 12.96% for all quality control levels. The matrix effect varied between 103.33% and 134.61%. This assay was successfully applied to the measurement of plasma concentrations in 6 HCC patients receiving lenvatinib. CONCLUSIONS: A novel high-throughput UHPLC-MS/MS assay for quantification of lenvatinib in human plasma was successfully developed. This method can be applied to PPK analysis for patients receiving lenvatinib in the clinical setting.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Monitoring the phosphoproteomics in cancer is expected to play a key role in optimizing treatments with kinase inhibitors. Clinical phosphoproteomics in surgical tissues and patient-derived models has been studied intensively. However, the reported data may not accurately reflect the phosphosignaling status in patients due to the effect of ischemia occurring during surgery or changes in the characteristics of cancer cells when establishing the models. In contrast, endoscopic biopsies have an advantage for clinical phosphoproteomics because they can be rapidly cryo-preserved. We aimed to develop a highly sensitive method for phosphoproteomics in endoscopic biopsies of gastric cancer. Methods: Three tumor biopsies and three normal gastric biopsies were obtained by endoscopy at one time, and subjected to our optimized phosphoproteomics. Phosphopeptides were enriched with an immobilized metal affinity chromatography, and labeled with Tandem Mass Tag reagent. Quantified phosphosites were compared between the pairs of tumor/normal biopsies within same patient. Cancer-specific activated pathways and kinases were identified by pathway enrichment analysis and kinase-substrate enrichment analysis. Results: Our protocol enabled the identification of more than 10,000 class 1 phosphosites from endoscopic biopsies. A comparison between samples from cancer tissue and normal mucosa demonstrated differences in the phosphosignaling, including biomarkers of response to DNA damage. Finally, cancer-specific activation of DNA damage response signaling was validated by additional phosphoproteomics of other patients and western blotting of gastric cancer/normal cells. Conclusion: In summary, our pioneering approach will facilitate more accurate clinical phosphoproteomics in endoscopic biopsies, which can be applied to monitor the activities of therapeutic kinases and, ultimately, can be a useful tool to precision medicine.","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.

However, there are little studies reporting that xCT inhibitors improve disease progression in vivo. To invent potent xCT inhibitors in vivo, we established a new in vivo model for assessing efficacy of xCT inhibition. dl-propargylglycine (PPG) was administered intraperitoneally to wild-type C57BL/6J mice. Concentration of cystathionine, another substrate of xCT, in the thymus and spleen was measured by LC-MS/MS. PPG increased cystathionine amounts in the thymus and spleen in a dose- and time-dependent manner. At 7 h after PPG administration, the efficacy of erastin, a representative xCT inhibitor, was clearly shown. We synthesized a new compound, Compound A, which had much higher inhibitory effect on xCT than erastin both in vitro and in vivo. We established a mouse model of PPG-induced cystathionine accumulation for assessing xCT inhibition in vivo. By using this model, we discovered that Compound A was approximately 15 times more effective in vivo than erastin.",Journal Article,

OBJECTIVE: To explore 76 prenatal maternal plasma EDC concentrations in a healthy obstetric cohort and 7 neonatal anthropometric endpoints by maternal race/ethnicity. METHODS: The study cohort comprised 2106 (564 White, 549 Black, 590 Hispanic, 403 Asian) healthy pregnant women recruited from 12 U.S. clinical sites between 2009 and 2012 who were followed through delivery. Neonates underwent standardized anthropometric assessment (weight, length, head and umbilical circumference, and mid- upper arm and thigh length). Plasma EDC concentrations were quantified using high resolution gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. EDCs were log-transformed and rescaled by their deviations (SD) when modeled relative to neonatal endpoints using linear regression adjusting for age, education, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), serum cotinine, serum lipids for lipophilic chemicals, and a race/ethnicity interaction term; p-values had false discovery rate correction (<0.05). RESULTS: The cohort comprised women aged 28 (SD = 5) years with normal BMIs (23.6 kg/m(2), SD = 3). Maternal EDC concentrations varied by self-identified race/ethnicity and neonatal outcomes, though no specific EDC was consistently associated with neonatal anthropometric outcomes across racial/ethnic groups. For the overall cohort, perfluorooctanoic acid was negatively associated with birth length per SD increase in concentration (beta = -0.23 cm; 95% CI -0.35, -0.10), while perfluorohexanesulfonic acid was negatively associated with umbilical circumference (beta = -0.26 cm; 95% CI -0.40, -0.13), perfluorodecanoic acid with arm length (-0.09 cm; 95% CI -0.14, -0.04), and PCBs congeners 118/106 (-0.12 cm; 95% CI -0.20, -0.04) and 146/161 (-0.14 cm; 95% CI -0.23, -0.05) with thigh length, as were 7 other poly-and-perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs). CONCLUSIONS: Among healthy pregnant women with low risk antenatal profiles and relatively low EDC concentrations, reductions in umbilical circumference and bone lengths may be a sensitive marker of intrauterine EDC exposure, particularly for PFAS.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",

The model predicted learning adaptations observed in hand-reaching experiments in humans wearing a prism lens and explained the kinetic components of these behavioral adaptations. The tandem system also predicted a form of subliminal motor learning that was experimentally validated after training intentional misses of hand targets. Patients with cerebellar degeneration disease showed behavioral impairments consistent with tandemly arranged internal models. These findings validate computational tandemization of internal models in motor control and its potential uses in more complex forms of learning and cognition.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Several strategies have been reported for screening reactive metabolites, such as a covalent binding assay with radioisotope-labeled drugs and a trapping method followed by LC-MS/MS analyses. Of these, a trapping method using glutathione is the most common, especially at the early stage of drug development. However, the cysteine of glutathione is not the only nucleophilic site in vivo; lysine, histidine, arginine, and DNA bases are also nucleophilic. Indeed, the glutathione trapping method tends to overlook several types of reactive metabolites, such as aldehydes, acylglucuronides, and nitroso compounds. Here, we introduce an alternate way for screening reactive metabolites as follows: A mixture of the light and heavy isotopes of simplified amino acid motifs and a DNA motif is used as a biomimetic trapping cocktail. This mixture consists of [(2)H(0)]/[(2)H(3)]-1-methylguanidine (arginine motif, Delta 3 Da), [(2)H(0)]/[(2)H(4)]-2-mercaptoethanol (cysteine motif, Delta 4 Da), [(2)H(0)]/[(2)H(5)]-4-methylimidazole (histidine motif, Delta 5 Da), [(2)H(0)]/[(2)H(9)]-n-butylamine (lysine motif, Delta 9 Da), and [(13)C(0),(15)N(0)]/[(13)C(1),(15)N(2)]-2'-deoxyguanosine (DNA motif, Delta 3 Da). Mass tag triggered data-dependent acquisition is used to find the characteristic doublet peaks, followed by specific identification of the light isotope peak using MS/MS. Forty-two model drugs were examined using an in vitro microsome experiment to validate the strategy. Graphical abstract Biomimetic trapping cocktail to screen reactive metabolites.",Journal Article,

This evolving literature contrasts with the largely equivocal findings reported for women's exposures and fecundity. While most evidence relies upon urinary concentrations, quantification of EDCs in seminal plasma may be more informative about potential toxicity arising within the testes. We analyzed 5 chemical classes of non-persistent EDCs in seminal plasma for 339 male partners of couples who were recruited prior to conception and who were followed daily until pregnant or after one year of trying. Benzophenones, bisphenols, parabens, and phthalate metabolites and phthalate diesters were measured using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) except for phthalate diesters, which were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Cox regression with discrete-time was used to estimate fecundability odds ratios (FORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each chemical to estimate the probability of pregnancy. While most EDCs were detected in seminal plasma, concentrations were lower than urinary concentrations previously analyzed for the cohort. None of the EDCs were significantly associated with fecundability even after covariate adjustment, though benzophenones consistently yielded FORs <1.0 (ranging from 0.72 to 0.91) in couple-adjusted models suggestive of diminished fecundity (longer TTP). The findings underscore that a range of EDCs can be quantified in seminal plasma, but the lower concentrations may require a large cohort for assessing couple fecundability, as well as the need to consider other fecundity outcomes such as semen quality.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural",Conflict of Interest - Disclosures The authors have no conflict of interest or financial interests that might benefit from this publication nor is the work under consideration elsewhere.

Whereas O(3) did not induce mutagenicity, O(3)/Cl, AOP, and AOP/Cl converted 3M4NP into mutagenic transformation products (TPs). Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we detected a total of 138 peaks in the solutions subjected to O(3)/Cl, AOP, and AOP/Cl. To elucidate the TPs responsible for the observed mutagenicity, we performed simple regression analyses of the relationship between the area of each peak and the observed mutagenicity of samples withdrawn periodically during each oxidation process. The area of each of 10 peaks was found to be positively correlated (r(2) >/= 0.8) with the observed mutagenicity, suggesting that the TPs corresponding to these peaks contributed to the mutagenicity. After taking into account the consistency of mutagenicity induction by the oxidation processes and analyzing the peaks by tandem mass spectrometry, we identified 3 TPs, corresponding to 6 peaks, as candidate mutagens. These TPs were assessed by means of 4 quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, and all 3 were predicted to be mutagenic by at least one model. This result was consistent with our assumption that these TPs were mutagens. Ames assays of an authentic sample of one of the 3 TPs revealed that it did not contribute to the mutagenicity. This left 3-methoxy-4-nitrophenol and 2-[(E)-[(2,5-dihydroxyphenyl) methylidene]amino]-5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde on the list of mutagens suspected of contributing to the mutagenicity induced by AOP.

Associations between the VNTR profiling data and a therapeutic response were evaluated in 59 subjects with M. avium lung infection. M. avium lung infection of 30 subjects in whom clarithromycin-containing regimens produced microbiological and radiographic improvement was defined as responsive disease, while that of the remaining 29 subjects was defined as refractory disease. In phylogenetic analysis using the genotypic distance aggregated from 16-dimensional VNTR data, 59 M. avium isolates were divided into three clusters, which showed a nearly significant association with therapeutic responses (p 0.06). We then subjected the raw 16-dimensional VNTR data directly to principal component analysis, and identified the genetic features that were significantly associated with the therapeutic response (p <0.05). By further analysis of logistic regression with a stepwise variable-selection, we constructed the highest likelihood multivariate model, adjusted for age, to predict a therapeutic response, using VNTR data from only four minisatellite loci.

In addition, changes in these markers produced by treatment with pitavastatin were evaluated. RESULTS: Serum non-cholesterol sterols, reflecting intestinal cholesterol absorption, were significantly lower in the NAFLD patients compared to the controls, and the cholesterol synthesis marker, the ratio of lathosterol to cholesterol, was not significantly different between the two groups. Serum proportions of liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) ligand oxysterols (ratios to cholesterol) were significantly elevated in the NAFLD patients compared to the controls. The sum of oxysterols relative to cholesterol and the homeostasis model assessment as an index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly correlated. The marker representing cholesterol synthesis was significantly suppressed by pitavastatin treatment, from 3 months after initiation of the treatment, and the suppression remained significant during the observation period. The markers representing cholesterol absorption were unchanged at 3 months, but had significantly increased at 12 months. Serum oxysterol levels relative to cholesterol maintained high values and did not change significantly during the 12-month period of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that serum LXRalpha ligand oxysterol levels (relative to cholesterol) could be surrogate markers of insulin resistance, and that high oxysterol levels in the circulation may play an important role in the development of hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance followed by NAFLD.","Clinical Trial, Journal Article, Multicenter Study, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",

This study aimed to discover a new diagnostic method for predicting the hematologic toxicities of gemcitabine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using quantitative mass spectrometry (MS), we compared the baseline plasma proteomes of 25 patients who had developed severe hematologic adverse events (grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and/or grade 2 to 4 thrombocytopenia) within the first two cycles of gemcitabine with those of 22 patients who had not (grade 0). RESULTS: We identified 757 peptide peaks whose intensities were significantly different (P < .001, Welch t test) among a total of 60,888. The MS peak with the highest statistical significance (P = .0000282) was revealed to be derived from haptoglobin by tandem MS. A scoring system (nomogram) based on the values of haptoglobin, haptoglobin phenotype, neutrophil count, platelet count, and body-surface area was constructed to estimate the risk of hematologic adverse events (grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and/or grade 2 to 4 thrombocytopenia) with an area under curve value of 0.782 in a cohort of 166 patients with pancreatic cancer. Predictive ability of the system was confirmed in two independent validation cohorts consisting of 87 and 52 patients with area under the curve values of 0.655 and 0.747, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although the precise mechanism responsible for the correlation of haptoglobin with the future onset of hematologic toxicities remains to be clarified, our prediction model seems to have high practical utility for tailoring the treatment of patients receiving gemcitabine.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",

However, our ability to understand mitochondrial dysfunction has been hindered by an absence of molecular markers defining the various degrees of injury. To address this paucity of knowledge, we sought to characterize the impact of ischemic damage on mitochondrial proteome biology. We hypothesized that ischemic injury induces differential alterations in various mitochondrial subcompartments, that these proteomic changes are specific to the severity of injury, and that they are important to subsequent cellular adaptations to myocardial ischemic injury. Accordingly, an in vitro model of cardiac mitochondria injury in mice was established to examine two stress conditions: reversible injury (induced by mild calcium overload) and irreversible injury (induced by hypotonic stimuli). Both forms of injury had a drastic impact on the proteome biology of cardiac mitochondria. Altered mitochondrial function was concomitant with significant protein loss/shedding from the injured organelles. In the setting of mild calcium overload, mitochondria retained functionality despite the release of numerous proteins, and the majority of mitochondria remained intact. In contrast, hypotonic stimuli caused severe damage to mitochondrial structure and function, induced increased oxidative modification of mitochondrial proteins, and brought about detrimental changes to the subproteomes of the inner mitochondrial membrane and matrix. Using an established in vivo murine model of regional myocardial ischemic injury, we validated key observations made by the in vitro model. This preclinical investigation provides function and suborganelle location information on a repertoire of cardiac mitochondrial proteins sensitive to ischemia reperfusion stress and highlights protein clusters potentially involved in mitochondrial dysfunction in the setting of ischemic injury.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",

This method is based upon a stable isotope dilution technique by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). C4 was extracted from human serum (2-50 mul) by a salting-out procedure, derivatized into the picolinoyl ester (C4-7alpha-picolinate), and then purified using a disposable C(18) cartridge. The resulting picolinoyl ester derivative of C4 was quantified by LC-MS/MS using the electrospray ionization mode. The detection limit of the C4 picolinoyl ester was found to be 100 fg (signal-to-noise ratio = 10), which was approximately 1,000 times more sensitive than the detection limit of C4 with a conventional HPLC-ultraviolet method. The relative standard deviations between sample preparations and between measurements by our method were calculated to be 5.7% and 3.9%, respectively, by one-way layout analysis. The recovery experiments were performed using serum spiked with 20.0-60.0 ng/ml C4 and were validated by a polynomial equation. The results showed that the estimated concentration with 95% confidence limit was 23.1 +/- 2.8 ng/ml, which coincided completely with the observed X(0) +/- SD = 23.3 +/- 1.0 ng/ml with a mean recovery of 93.4%. This method provides highly reliable and reproducible results for the quantification of C4, especially in small volumes of blood samples.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",

A complete summary of the allele frequency distributions for these Y-STRs is presented in the Appendix. This manuscript describes in more detail some of the population genetic and evolutionary aspects for a restricted set of seven chromosome Y STRs in a selected number of population samples. For all the chromosome Y STRs markedly different region-specific allele frequency distributions were observed, also when closely related populations were compared. Haplotype analyses using AMOVA showed that when four different European male groups (Germans, Dutch, Swiss, Italians) were compared, less than 10% of the total genetic variability was due to differences between these populations. Nevertheless, these pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences between most population pairs. Assuming a step-wise mutation model and a mutation frequency of 0.21%, it was estimated that chromosome Y STR-based evolutionary lines of descent can be reliably inferred over a time-span of only 1950 generations (or about 49,000 years). This reduces the reliability of the inference of population affinities to a historical, rather than evolutionary time scale. This is best illustrated by the construction of a human evolutionary tree based on chromosome Y STRs in which most of the branches connect in a markedly different way compared with trees based on classical protein polymorphisms and/or mtDNA sequence variation. Thus, the chromosome Y STRs seem to be very useful in comparing closely related populations which cannot probably be separated by e.g. autosomal STRs. However, in order to be used in an evolutionary context they need to be combined with more stable Y-polymorphisms e.g. base-substitutions.","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Multicenter Study",

The rII deletion r1589 blocks only the function of the rIIA cistron, although it extends into the B cistron. Another rII deletion, r1236, blocks the function of the rIIB cistron and overlaps r1589. When a cross is made between r1589 and r1236, true rII+ progeny cannot form. Instead, anomalous phenotypically rII+ phages are detected carrying an rII region from each parent. Analyses of nucleotide sequences of the recombination junctions indicate that recombination takes place between short regions of homology (from 2 to 10 bp). Open reading frames of the recombinants deduced from the nucleotide sequences reveal that they contain a normal rIIA cistron and one of a variety of fused, duplicated rIIB cistrons. The T4 uvsX and uvsY genes, which participate in homologous recombination, are involved in this duplication formation. T4 DNA topoisomerase is encoded by genes 39, 52 and 60. Mutations in 52 and 60 reduced the frequency of such duplications, but mutations in gene 39 and some in gene 52 did not. Hence, the effects of topoisomerase mutations are allele-specific. Models are proposed in which these proteins are involved in tandem duplication.","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",

OBJECTIVE: To find an association between EDCs in seminal plasma and semen quality parameters. METHODS: Five chemical classes of non-persistent EDCs were quantified in seminal plasma from 339 male partners who participated in a prospective pregnancy study. Bisphenols, benzophenone UV-filters, antimicrobials and phthalate diesters and their monoester metabolites were measured using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Semen samples underwent next day analysis using a standardized protocol for the quantification of 35 endpoints. Linear mixed-effects models of EDCs that were log transformed and rescaled by their standard deviations or dichotomized at the 75th percentile for each exposure and outcomes with covariate adjustment were performed. EDCs in seminal plasma were also assessed relative to clinical reference values of semen quality endpoints using logistic regression or generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: The most consistent findings supporting adverse associations between seminal EDCs and semen quality were observed for some phthalate metabolites. For example, seminal plasma mono-ethyl, mono-n-butyl, mono-2-isobutyl and mono-benzyl phthalate concentrations were associated with decreased odds of having semen volume above clinical reference values (mEP: aOR=0.46; 95%CI= 0.32, 0.66; mBP: aOR=0.40; 95%CI= 0.28, 0.57; miBP: aOR=0.39; 95%CI= 0.27, 0.56), and mBzP: aOR= 0.34; 95%CI= 0.24, 0.49). CONCLUSIONS: Environmentally relevant concentrations of specific phthalates in seminal plasma were associated with diminished semen volume, sperm motility, viability, and morphological alterations in sperm heads such that semen volume and sperm viability fall below reference values.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",
